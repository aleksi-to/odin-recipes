    <p> My mom's 7-layer dip is a big hit at all small gatherings! Refried beans are layered with guacamole, taco-seasoned sour cream, veggies, and cheese; it's perfect for dipping tortilla chips. The dip traditionally takes less time to disappear into bellies than it does to prepare.</p>

        <li>2 avocados - peeled, pitted and diced</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
