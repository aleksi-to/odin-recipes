    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p> I made this up one day when I couldn't find a recipe anywhere with these ingredients. So I kind of threw it together on a whim. Sugar can be adjusted for sweetness, and if the sauce gets a bit thicker than desired I suggest adding a little chicken broth as it's thickening. Serve immediately over rice.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package Polish sausage, or to taste, cut into 1-inch squares</li>
        <li>1 large onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 large green bell pepper, cut into 1-inch squares</li>
        <li>Â¾ fresh pineapple - peeled, cored, and cut into chunks</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat.  </li>
        <li>Cook and stir sausage, onion, and green bell pepper until vegetables start to become tender, about 8 minutes; add pineapple and cook, stirring occasionally, until the pineapple is hot, about 5 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Beat pineapple juice and cornstarch together in a bowl using a whisk.</li>
        <li>Stir brown sugar, cider vinegar, soy sauce, and minced garlic with the pineapple juice until the sugar dissolves into the liquid.</li>
        <li>Pour over the sausage mixture and cook until the sauce thickens, 5 to 8 minutes. </li>
    </ol>
